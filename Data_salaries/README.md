# Questions

- Is there a correlation between the year and data salaries?
- How does experience level (junior, mid-level, senior) impact data salaries?
- Does employment type (Full-time, Contract, Part-time) affect data salaries?
- What are the salary differences across different data-related job titles?
- Have these differences remained consistent or changed over the years?
- How do data salaries vary across different company locations?
- Does the size of the company (Small, Medium, Large) influence data salaries?
- Is there a correlation between changes in the job market (e.g., demand for data professionals) and data salary trends over the years?

- Companies designated in the US paid more to their employees compared to other geographical locations such as Great britain, France, Germany, Japan and many more.
- Interms of company size, Medium companies out did Large companies in total salaries paid by 740.25%. This is due to the number of employees at Medium companies being 2,699 more than Large company employees.

- Some roles such as Data Architect had only on employee in the whole of Great britain which seems way off.
