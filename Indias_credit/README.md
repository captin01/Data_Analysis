# Brief Summary

- The top city was Greater Mumbai in total amount and card types (card packages)
- Silver card type (card package) was the most used and highest generated total amount compared to the other card types.
- Bills was the most common expense generated for each card type. Meaning cards were used for paying bills overral.
- For the findings we can speculate that women take financial responsibility in their house holds.
- The target audience is women for better co-operate growth for businesses.
- Travel was the lowest total expense type, meaning :

1. A good majority of the population cant afford to travel often.
2. Seasons best for travel collide with their religious/festive seasons.
3. Since not a lot of people travel, most travel agencies are unable to give affordable travel packages thus forcing stunted growth
   in the travel industry.

# Limitaions

- The data was old but informative.
- some regions such as Fazilka only had male contributes, which is highly unlikely that a city would only have one specific gender.
